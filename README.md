# Module7_Employee_Database_challenge
### Overview of the analysis
We wanted to sift throught the data that we had and determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This would help prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

### Results

- We found that the number of Retiring employees by title
- The title with the most employees retiring is the _Senior Engineer_ title
- The title with the least employees retiring is the _Manager_ title

#### Deliverable 2
We wanted to find the employes that are elligible for the mentorship program.
**- We found 1549 employees ready for the Mentorship program.**
- This would suggest that the company is ready to take the employees who are leaving the company and have them train/mentor new employees.

### Results

#### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
-Seeing that 1549 employees are about to retire, we would need to fill that many roles as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact.
Here is a break down of the 1549 employees by title:

As you can see you need to replace the 568 Senior Staff as well as the 501 Engineers.

#### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
If the amount of individuals they wish to hire is less than or equal to the 1549 employees retiring then Pewlett should be fine. However, they would need to keep in mind to hire similar ratio to those that they are retiring.
